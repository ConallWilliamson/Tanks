To do:
- Implement tank-border collision detection, refactor slightly so that collisions are handled within the border class itself, rather than in the block class.
- Implement steering behaviours: 
  - Wall following behaviour until the pursuer has a clear view to the target
  - Pursue behaviour othrwise
- add theta to the turret in the constructor (angle between the origin and the muzzle), then use the turret's theta as the bullet's theta. Never update theta.
- Decide what to do with enemy tanks. Probably have a generic tank with generic methods and then other tanks with specific steering behaviours. Probably pass
  whether the tank is AI, neural net or human controlled via the constructor.





Done:
- add tank movement
- fix bug with bullet's move method. It appears to miss the mouseX and mouseY.
- fix tank movement. The tank should slowly accelerate and then decelerate once the steering force is no longer applied.
- Destroy bullets either on collision or if they travel too far.
- Add borders and breakable blocks
