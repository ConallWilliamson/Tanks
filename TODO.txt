To do:
- add theta to the turret in the constructor (angle between the origin and the muzzle), then use the turret's theta as the bullet's theta. Never update theta.
- destroy bullets either on collision or if they travel too far. (Maybe have their collide method check for intersections with the canvas)
- Add borders and breakable blocks
- Decide what to do with enemy tanks. Probably have a generic tank with generic methods and then other tanks with specific behaviours. Probably pass
  whether the tank is AI, neural net or human controlled via the constructor.





Fixed:
- add tank movement (maybe use something similar to control class from car video)
- fix bug with bullet's move method. It appears to miss the mouseX and mouseY.
- fix tank movement. The tank should slowly accelerate and then decelerate once the steering force is no longer applied.
